        <p id="mission"> Our club is focused on creating a website
          focused around providing helpful study tools</span>
          for students such as <b>customizable quizzes</b> and <b>flashcards</b>. These quizzes and flashcards
          will be shareable so students can use these tools in study groups, allowing for a large
          amount of people to benefit from them. Additionally, this website will be public to allow
          anyone to be able to use our programs at <b>no cost</b>.</p>

        <h2 id="programs">The Programs We Make</h2>
        <p id="programs">Our website will be equipped with a multitude
          of programs and tools designed to help students
          learn. So far we are planning on implementing a <b>flash card program</b> that will help students
          <b>memorize definitions of words</b> or ideas and other similar programs. We will also be using public
          input to generate ideas on which methods and studying devices will be most effective. The tools
          will be made using <b>HTML</b> and <b>java</b>.

        <p id="motive"> At STAMV we have 1 main motive. This motive is to
          provide students with a reliable way to learn
          and study by creating programs gearead towards this on our website. Because quizlet no longer
          offers free custom quizzes without a premium account, we felt it best to provide a solution by
          making our own platform to make and share quizzes, among other things beneficial to
          studying and helping students learn.</p>
