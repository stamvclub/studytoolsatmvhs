    <p id="text"> We are a group of a high school students that came
      together because of our passion for coding
      and desire to help others. We wish to do so by creating study programs which can help students
      prepare for quizzes, tests, and other academic assignments. We created both this website
      and the programs from scratch. We used HTML and CSS for the website and JavaScript to create
      the programs. </p>

        <p id="text1"> My name is Dylan Robles and I am the President of
          Study Tools at Mountain View
          (STAMV). One of my passions is coding and I always wanted to use this in helping
          others. Being a student at MVHS, I noticed that studying effectively can be
          challenging. I saw a need to address this issue, so I got together with Lucian
          and we decided to create STAMV.

          apply my skills in coding to a real world problem. When Dylan approached me with STAMV I knew
          that it would be a great way to do that, so I took the opportunity.

          View students. We all have our own unique ways of learning and the more
          choices and control we can have over our study tools, the more successful
          we can be!
