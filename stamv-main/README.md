//Hello, Welcome to STAMV!

We are a group of a high school students that came together because of our passion for coding and desire to help others. We wish to do so by creating study programs which can help students prepare for quizzes, tests, and other academic assignments. We created both this website and the programs from scratch. We used HTML and CSS for the website and JavaScript to create the programs.
